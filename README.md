# A-Star
Project that reads in 2 cities from the command line and returns the shortest possible path by utilizing the A-star algorithm.

## Using the A-Star algorithm as default

To use the A-Star algorithm run the a-star.py program from a command line passing two cities as the first and second cities as arguments.

To see the list of possible cities, pass two strings that aren't cities to the command line.


## Expanding or customizing the program

To customize the program, open the coordinates file to add cities with their respective coordinates. 

>For example, Ventura:(34.2805, 119.2945)

Then, subsequently add cities with some connections and adjacent cities to build the graph:

>For example, Ventura-SantaBarbara(27.4),LosAngeles(67.7),LongBeach(93.5)

Program should be able to run from there and produce the shortest path by inputting into the command line. :) enjoy!
